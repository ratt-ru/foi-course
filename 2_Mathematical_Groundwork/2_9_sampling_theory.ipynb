    "Our goal in radio interferometry is to produce a map of the sky by sampling a finite number of spatial frequency modes present in its spectrum (this will become clearer as the course unfolds). By sampling only a discrete number of frequency modes we are effectively turning a continuous problem into a discrete one. Recall that at the end of the last section we saw some peculiarities in the output of the discrete Fourier transform (DFT). In particular we note the following features:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * That there were non-zero components $Y_k$ at frequencies which were not present in the input signal.\n",
    "   * That the amplitudes of the $Y_k$ corresponding to the frequencies present in the input signal were not all equal dispite the fact that they are the same in the input signal.\n",
    "   * That is was not possible to find the frequencies present in the input signal when $N$ (the number of samples) was below a certain number. \n",

    "These features will, in some form or another, also be present in radio interferometry. The aim of this section is to develop an intuitive understanding of why the above features are present in the discrete spectrum. This requires discussing aliasing and the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem (or just sampling theorem for short) which will allow us to answer questions such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Given the (effective) diameter of a telescope, what is the maximum pixel size we can choose for the reconstructed image?\n",
    "* Which of the features in the reconstructed image are real features corresponding to the sky and which are artificial features introduced by sampling only a limited number of frequency modes?\n",

    "Note that, in interferometry, we are sampling in the spatial frequency domain. Unfortunately, our intuition does not extend as easily to this domain. We are more inclined to think of the world in terms of a sequence of events i.e. in the time domain. A similar statement is true in interferometry. Our intuition extends more easily to the image domain than to its spectral dual. In this section, for simplicity, we will use time series to get a feeling for what is going on in the dual Fourier space viz. the frequency domain. "

    "Hopefully, you will have noticed that the information contained in $Y_k$ is very sensitive to the sampling interval $\\Delta t$. The Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem explains why it is not possible to recover the frequency information contained in a signal when the sampling becomes too course i.e. $\\Delta t$ is too large or $N$ is too small. One way to state the theorem is that, when sampling a signal at an interval $\\Delta t$ (equivalently a frequency of $f_s = \\frac{1}{\\Delta t}$), it is not possible to recover any frequency information above a frequency of $f_N = \\frac{1}{2\\Delta t} = \\frac{f_s}{2}$. We call $f_N$ the *Nyquist frequency*. In the above example we kept the sampling interval fixed. Thus, by decreasing $N$, we increase the width of the sampling interval $\\Delta t$ and hence decrease $f_N$. This explains the seemingly erratic behaviour of $|Y_k|$ as $N \\rightarrow 0$. Note that, at $f_1 = 1$Hz, $f_2 = 2$Hz and $f_3 = 3$Hz, the input frequencies remain the same. Decreasing $N$ below a certain limit therefore results in a value of $f_N$ less than the maximum frequency present in the signal. Proving the sampling theorem is trivial once the Poisson summation formula has been established. Recall that, by the Poisson summation formula, the periodic summation of the spectrum $Y(f)$ of the (Schwartz) function $y(t)$ can be obtained as a Fourier series with coefficients $y_n = \\Delta t \\ y(n \\Delta t)$ i.e. "

Now suppose we have a signal $y(t)$ which contains no frequencies above a certain upper limit called the bandwidth which we denote $B$ (in other words we have a bandlimited signal).

    "Note that, in order to use this formula, we still need an infinite number of samples of $y(t)$, something which is impossible in practice. The operation of transforming the RHS into the LHS is effectively a digital to analogue conversion since we are going from a finitely sampled signal $y_n$ to a continuous approximation $y(t)$. This could be implemented approximately using, for example, the zero-order hold model (see [here &#10548;](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-order_hold) for example). The approximation error reduces if the signal is sufficiently oversampled (i.e. sampled at intervals $\\Delta t < \\frac{1}{2f_N}$). Undersampling, on the other hand, results in aliasing. "

    "We have already touched upon the concept of aliasing. Recall that, during our discussion on periodic summation, we noted that the Discrete Time Fourier Transform (DTFT) results in a periodic summation $Y_{f_s}(f)$ of the spectrum $Y(f)$ of the signal $y(t)$. The copies of $Y(f)$ at $k \\neq 0$ were called aliases. From the discussion above, we also know that, when the signal is undersampled, these aliases will start to overlap resulting in a distortion of the spectrum $Y(f)$. This is what is usually refered to as *aliasing*. If we try to reconstruct the signal $y(t)$ from the distorted spectrum we will end up with *artefacts* in the signal $y(t)$. Here we will demonstrate the consequences of aliasing with a simple example and explain the implications this has for practical applications of the DFT.   "

    "Notice that the spectrum is reflected about $f_N$. As we noted before, this happens because of periodicity and because the DFT of a real valued signal is Hermitian. Since these additional frequency peaks do not contain any new information, they do not present a problem when trying to recover the signal $y(t)$ from its spectrum. Any non-zero frequency components above $f_N$ can safely be discarded. A more troublesome feature of the spectrum is that input frequencies $f_i$ above $f_N$ are folded or aliased back into the spectrum i.e. a frequency at $f_i = f_N + \\epsilon$ appears at $f_k = f_N - \\epsilon$. This effect is referred to as aliasing. It can, in principle, be eliminated by applying anti-aliasing filters to the signal. Unfortunately the details behind practical implementations of anti-aliasing filters is beyond the scope of the current discussion. Here we will simply give a brief illustration of what they do.  "
