Thus, if $\\bf{A}$ and ${\\bf b}$ are fixed, we can use the pdf to find the most likely value of ${\\bf x}$ which we denote ${\\bf \\bar{x}}$. Doing so is actually surprisingly simple, well at least when the system is of full rank. First note that the position of the maximum in the likelihood does not change on taking the log of the pdf, a fact which comes in handy in numerical applications. The negative log likelihood of the Gaussian pdf is called the $\\chi^2$ distribution and it takes the following form (note this is simply the negative of the quantity in the exponent)\n",

This allows us to use numerical minimisation schemes (of which you will hear more of in the next section [2.11 Least-squares Minimization &#10142;](2_11_least_squares.ipynb)) to find ${\\bf \\bar{x}}$. Actually, when the system is of full rank, there is a simpler analytic way to find ${\\bf \\bar{x}}$. This is because a Gaussian pdf has only a single stationary point. You should remember (from first year calculus) how to find this stationary point i.e. take the derivative and set it to zero. The only (hopefully) slightly tricky part is taking the gradient of $\\chi^2$ w.r.t. ${\\bf x}$ (i.e. finding the Jacobian). The expression for the Jacobian is\n",

Iterative minimisation techniques are discussed in the next section [2.11 Least-squares Minimization &#10142;](2_11_least_squares.ipynb).
