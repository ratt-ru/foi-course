Before we dive into specifics of radio interferometric imaging using aperture synthesis, we will cover the ideas which relate the spatial domain (i.e. an image) to the spatial frequency domain (i.e. the visibilities). To do this we will start with the Fourier transform which is the mathematics that relate the two domains. Using that framework we will transform simple signals between the two domains to understand how the a signal in one domain appears in the other. This is the groundwork we need to understand before we can start constructing sky images from the observed visibilities of an interferometric array."

A useful idea is that the sky is made up of mostly 'point source' objects which one might call stars or galaxies or blobs. Whatever these are, they are 'unresolved' sources or *delta functions*. Equation [above &#10549;](#eq:dft2_VI) states that a delta function in an image is a complex sinusoidal wave in the visibility domain and vica-versa. This means that one does not need to fully sample the visibility space to detect a point source in the image domain. Put in other words, this is an issue a signal being sparse in one domain (image) and dense in another domain (visibility). It is to our advantage to make a measurement in a domain where the signal is spread through-out the space and then transform the observed signal into a more preferable (but sparser) domain.\n",

The painting is the spatial-domain image, and one can think of a point in the spatial-frequency domain as representing the amount of paint (in our case, a complex power) applied using a specific brush size at a specific stroke angle. In the spatial frequency domain, all points at the same radius represent the same sized paint brush but at all possible stroke angles. And, points further out represent smaller paint brushes (that is the brushes which can do fine details) compared to points closer to the centre which are for the large structures such as flat backgrounds. Additionally, not as much stroke angle control is required for the large paint brushes compared to the smaller brushes, so only a few points are need in the spatial frequency domain to fully represent a large brush.\n",

Taking the logarithm of the image results in something similar to the amplitude figure of the Fourier transformed image shown earlier in the section. A way to think about the phase and amplitude information is that phase information describes the structure of an image, that is, where the power needs to be placed. And ampltiude information describes the intensity of that structure given a position. The constructive and destructive interference of all the sinusoidal waves leads to a reconstruction of the image. If the amplitudes of all the sinusoidal waves is unity then there is still interference between the waves leading to a partial image. But, if that phase information is gone then there will be no interference and there will only be noise in the reconstructed image.\n",

The Fourier transformed signal is redundant along a diagonal axis, each value above the diagonal has an equivalent (conjugated) value below the diagonal. Now if only the real-component is used to inverse Fourier transform back to the spatial domain then this results in an image which is the sum of the original image and a $180^{\\circ}$ rotated image, this is an addition because conjugation does not effect the sign of the real components. The imaginary-component image is the difference image of the original and a $180^{\\circ}$ rotated image because the conjugation flips the imaginary sign."

The second wave changes frequency and direction based on the position of the second source. From the first row we can see that because the sources are aligned in $x$, then the phase of both goes top to bottom, but at different frequencies. Similarly, in the second row, the sources are aligned in $y$ and thus both phases go left to right. In the third row we see that the phase is at an angle because of the second source position.\n",

But, as we progressively increase the number of sampled positions structure starts to appear until eventually the original duck image re-emerges. Basically, we are selecting a collection of spatial frequencies, giving them different amplitudes and creating an image out of those components, we just happen to be picking ones such that we are constructing a duck. But, any image can be constructed by setting the correct amplitudes and phases of various spatial frequencies.\n",
