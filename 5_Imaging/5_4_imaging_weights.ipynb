So far we have discussed sampling functions as if they are binary functions, a visibility domain pixel is given a value of 1 if a baseline track measured that location otherwise the pixel was given a value of 0. The allocation of 0 to each pixel which was not measured should make sense, as there is no information, and thuse that pixel can potentially have any value. But, for the measured pixels the sampling function value does not necessarily need to be 1. For example, say an observation results in 1000 uv positions being measured, and 100 of these positions were measured 10 times while the other 900 positions were only measured once. The 100 positions measured 10 times, will have a $\\sqrt{10}$ improvement in sensitivity compared to the other 900 positions, so perhaps those 100 spatial frequency modes should be given more weight in the resulting image because we are more sure about the accuracy of the measurement. Or, perhaps an array is made up of many different types of telescopes which leads to some baselines having a higher sensitivity to other baselines, such as in VLBI. Or, perhaps the science case is only interested in certain spatial frequencies, such as seperating point sources from large-scale gas structure. These are all examples of times when we would like to adjust our sampling function, which leads to a number of different options we need to understand when creating an image. In fact, there is no standard set of options to create an image from visibilities, a weighting function must always be decided upon before hand. The most common weighting function we must decide on when imaging is the density weighting function, but we will also discuss the beam taper and reliability weighting.\n",

        "As a simple example let us look at some 1-D weight functions and the resulting PSFs. For this example lets say we sample the inner centre of a 1-D function. This results in a square or boxcar sampling, as seen in blue in the left-hand figure below. But, say we think some samples are 'better' than others. For example, our detector has a linear response based on the distance from the zero point. Then, we would like to weigh the samples accordingly, giving more weight to samples near the centre and less to the samples on the far edges. This results in a triangle weight function, as seen in green in the left-hand figure below. Or, perhaps a Gaussian weighting function, red in the left-hand figure below, is more appropriate. There are many types of potential weighting functions which all cover the same extent of the sample space. But, these weighting functions result in different PSF responses as seen in the right-hand figure. Using a boxcar weighting function (blue) results in the highest PSF primary lobe, but the sidelobes are significantly higher compared to other weighting functions. This relates to the idea that a smooth function in one domain is also a smooth function in its Fourier domain, and a boxcar function is not a smooth function. A Gaussian function is a smooth function, but the sampling extent (or window in signal processing terms) is finite, this means that there is a cut-off point. The PSF response of a truncated Gaussian (green) has a wider primary lobe but lower sidelobes compared to the boxcar function. As does the triangle function which can as a simple approximation to the Gaussian."

That is, during the observation those pixels in the visibility domain were sampled multiple times due to a combination of the frequency bandwidth coverage and the uv track positions. In this case, when we formed the PSF response we decided to give each sample a equal weighting, this resulted in the pixels have a range of weights. This is similar to the Gaussian weighting function in the 1-d example above. This weighting scheme is called *natural weighting* (or inverse variance weighting), it has the advantage of maximizing sensitivity but at the cost of resolution. It is often stated in literature that natural weighting lead to broad 'wings' in the PSF primary lobe, this is due to the over representation of the low spatial frequency modes.\n",
        "\n",
        "A complimentary weight scheme is *uniform weighting* (or unity weighting) which weights each sample positon equally, not matter how many times that position was sampled. This is akin to the boxcar weighting function in the 1-d example above, and results in a higher resolution image at the cost of higher PSF sidelobes.\n",

        "As covered in the [gridding section &#10142;](5_3_gridding_and_degridding.ipynb), when gridding the sampled visibilities are placed into pixels, that is a 2-D grid array. If no samples are placed in a pixel then that pixel obviously is given zero weight. For a given pixel, if only one sample is placed at that position then it would seem we could justify giving that pixel a weight of one. But, as we have seen, multiple samples, or 'portion' of samples can be placed in a single pixel. If a sample is split between multiple pixels the total allocated weight of the combined positions for that sample should equal one, e.g. if a pixel is split between two pixels $(p_a, p_b)$, with 60% of the flux belonging in $p_a$ and 40% in $p_b$ then the sample is given a weight of 0.6 in $p_a$ and 0.4 in $p_b$. For multiple samples, the weight is the sum of the number of samples. Thus, we define a function $N_s(u,v)$ which returns the number of samples for a given pixel $(u,v)$.

The fundamental idea presented in this thesis was that natural and uniform weighting were simply two schemes on a continuum of possible weighting schemes controlled by a single parameter called the robustness. For this reason, this generalized weighting scheme is called robust weighting (it is also often called Briggs' weighting). The robustness parameter $R$ was developed such that at its two extreme values robust weighting approximated natural and uniform weighting and the zero point for $R$ represents an equal balance between resolution and image variance. The exact implementation of robust weighting varies between imagers, but all imagers should produce similar results."

When imaging the pixel resolution and and number of pixels (field of view imaged) is adjustable. This means that the scale of the a pixel will change depending on these parameters. Thus, a low resolution image will include more visibility samples per pixel compared to a higher resolution image, and result in a different PSF response even when using the same weighting function.

If an observation is made with an array of identical elements then the relative reliability of each visibility measurement would be the same. But, say one element of an array has a higher system temperature (i.e. it is noisier) or the element has a smaller dish (less sensitive) then any baseline correlation which includes this element will result in a noisier measurment and should be weighted as such. A priori information, such as an elements effective collection area or expected system temperature, can be included in this function. Variability in the performance of individual elements during an observation is also included in this function. For example, if one of the telescopes has a noisy amplifier which needs to be fixed compared to the other telecsopes in the array. For mixed arrays such as with VLBI each individual telescope will have a different sensitivity which needs to factored in. If no relibabilty weights are included in the original observation then this function is set to unity and ignored."

        "From the dirty images presented earlier in this section we can see that around the sources there are PSF-like sidelobes, but we know that this is an effect of the visibility sampling (our measurement instrument) and not the part of the true sky. So we can then ask, can we remove these sidelobes? And, what is the effect if we can? The answer to the second question is that if we can remove some of the larger sidelobes then we should be able to find other weaker sources in the field that could be hidden below, i.e. the noise floor of the image would be lower. We would say that the dynamic range increases if those sidelobes can be removed. The answer to the first question is that we can remove the structure imposed by the measurement to an extent by the use of deconvolution methods.\n",

        "The term 'dirty image' came about after the initial development of synthesis imaging, the term was introduced when deconovlution methods, in particular the CLEAN method, were introduced to recover a 'better' image from the observed visibilities. The concept of better is subjective and not well-defined. But, the main idea is that a dirty image contains bright sources which are surrounded by PSF-like sidelobes due to the irregular visibility sampling. By making the assumption that the sky should be smooth and continuous then we can also assume the visibilities are smooth and continuous. Even though we are only sampling a portion of the visibilities we can use this assumption to enforce a smoothness which results in a 'clean' image in which the PSF has been deconvolved. This will be discussed in detail in the next chapter."

        "But, before we introduce deconvolution we will finish the chapter on the issue of imaging large field of views. At the start of this section we presented an equation which relates the dirty image to the measured visibilities, but this is an approximate equation. The w-term has been ignored to reduce the equation down to a 2-D Fourier transform. This equation holds well for a narrow field of view, but we are often interested in imaging larger fields of view with arrays spread over large areas. In order to do this the w-term must be included. A number of techniques are routinely used to effectively include preturbations to the simple 2-D Fourier relation between visibilities and the image to compensate for the missing w-term. This is that topic that will be covered in the next section."
