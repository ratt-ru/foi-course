The $uv$-track is thus the set of spatial frequencies (i.e.$uv$ points) which a single baseline will sample over the course of an observation.\n",
        "\n",
        "In [$\\S$ 4.5.2 &#10549;](4_5_2_uv_coverage_improving_your_coverage.ipynb), we discussed three different ways of improving your $uv$ coverage. Firstly, we can increase the number of antennas and alter their distribution: this improves the *instantaneous* spatial coverage. Second, we can use the fact that the observed source is moving with the Celestial Sphere (i.e. the Earth spins). The continuous variation of the projected baseline - and therefore its $u,v$-coordinates - allow us to sample portions of elliptical $uv$ tracks. \n",
        "\n",
        "A long integration time allows astronomers to easily improve their $uv$-plane coverage at little cost. Note that maximising using this technique to improve $uv$-coverage will require taking more measurements in time, thus increasing computational costs.\n",
        "\n",
        "Thirdly, by using broadband receivers, we can sample the visibilities at various frequencies and compute the cross-correlations in different frequency channels. By doing so, the $uv$-coverage is improved along radial $uv$ tracks.\n",
        "Of course, these methods cannot extend our $uv$-coverage arbitrarily. They are limited by both the instrument sensitivity and the instrument's point source response (see [$\\S$ 9.3 &#10142;](../9_Practical/9_3_Observing_smearing.ipynb)).\n",
        "\n",
        "In [$\\S$ 4.6  &#10142;](4_6_the_fourier_approximation_van_cittert-zernike_theorem.ipynb) we will explicitly enunciate the underlying hypotheses we relied on in the previous section. This section is required before we can begin to treat the topic of *imaging* in [$\\S$ 5 &#10142;](../5_Imaging/5_0_introduction.ipynb)."
