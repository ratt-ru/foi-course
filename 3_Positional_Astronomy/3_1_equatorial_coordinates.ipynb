Due to the *precession* (the change in the orientation of the earth's rotational axis) the location of the stars do in fact change minutely during the course of one generation. That is why we need to link the equatorial coordinates of a celestial object in a catalogue to a specific observational epoch (a specific instant in time). We can then easily compute the true coordinates as they would be today given the equatorial coordinates from a specific epoch as a starting point. There are two popular epochs that are often used, namely J2000  and B1950. Expressed in [<cite data-cite=''>UT (Universal Time)</cite> &#10548;](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Time):\n",
