        "The natural question now arises, why do we need separate time-keeping systems to keep track of the stars and the sun? The answer is that a *sidereal day* is 4 minutes shorter than a *solar day*. A solar day is the time it takes for the sun to return to the same position in the sky, while a sidereal day is the amount of time it takes for an arbitrary star to return to the same location in the sky. We can explain the reason for this time difference with the aid of <a class='pos_fig_sid_halst'></a> <!--\\ref{pos:fig:sid}-->. When the sun reappears at the same location in the sky (after 24 hours) it appears to have moved on the celestial sphere (it has moved relative to the background stars). The apparent movement of the sun on the celestial sphere is due to the fact that the earth needs to complete a little bit more than one full rotation for the sun to reappear at the same position in the sky. It needs a little bit more than one full rotation due to the fact that the earth orbits the sun. Since the background stars are much further away the earth only needs one full rotation (23 hours and 56 minutes) for an arbitrary star to reappear at the same position in the sky."

As discussed in the previous paragraph the sun appears to move on the celestial sphere (its right ascension and declination changes throughout the year).

We investigate this phenomenon below. We again make use of the `pyephem` package. We only use the `Observer` class in the code snippet below. An observer object has a date attribute to which a date time string in [<cite data-cite=''>UTC (Coordinated Universal Time)</cite> &#10548;](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time) can be assigned. One also needs to set the geographical coordinates of the observer object. In the example below we chose the geographical coordinates to be equal to the Jodrell Bank Observatory. The observer object then has a method called `sidereal_time` which can calculate the current sidereal time of the observer given the current time of the observer in UTC. We plot the local sidereal time of the observer at 23:59:59 UTC on the 22nd of each month for an entire year (2016) in <a class='pos_fig_lstutc_halst'></a>."
