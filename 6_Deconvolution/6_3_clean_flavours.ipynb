    "In the previous section we introduced the concept of iterative deconvolution using a point-source approximation to the sky, also known as `CLEAN`. That example was more precisely an image-domain implementation of `CLEAN`. There are in fact multiple variants of `CLEAN` as it has been extended over the years to improve results, mainly due to advancements in computing power that have lead to more compute intensive operations being possible. Today there is an active field of developing more advanced `CLEAN` implementation and deconvolution algorithms which can solve special cases. These will be briefly discussed at the end of this section. We will first discuss the implementation and advantages/disadvantages of the basic variants of `CLEAN`: image-domain, gridded visibility-domain, and visibility-domain.\n",

Thus, $\\gamma$ is set somewhere between 0 and 1, a typical value would be $0.1$, this means that each iteration 10% of the peak flux value is subtracted from the residual image. If the loop gain is too high then the deconvolution maybe over ambitious and subtract out noise from the image, leading to 'holes' in the image.

    "This is the simplest implementation of `CLEAN` but is also limited as one would expect from being the original `CLEAN` method. The first issue is that the residual image and PSF are images with a fixed number of pixels. When subtracting flux from the residual image the PSF is offset, thus flux from only a subset of the residual image is subtracted. This requires either computing a PSF image at least twice as large (in both directions for 4 times the number of pixels), or limiting deconvolution to the centre of the residual image. The second issue is that the sky model is fixed to the resolution of the pixels in the residual image, this leads to artefacts as sources are never perfectly at the centre of a pixel. Accounting for these issues lead to the next developments in `CLEAN`."

An implementation of this method is left as an [exercise &#10142;](clark_clean_assignment.ipynb), a starting point notebook with helper functions is provided. The general structure of his method was to search for a set of bright pixels in the image domain (above some threshold based on the PSF sidelobes), build a partial sky model in the 'minor' cycle. The partial sky model needs to be convolved with the PSF before being subtracted from the residual image. Using the Fourier transform and convolution theorem the the sky model and PSF can be Fourier transformed and multiplied together in the visibility domain, inverse Fourier transformed back to the image domain and subtracted from the previous residual image to produce an updated residual image. This has the advantage of potentially being faster than Högbom's method, and allows for deconvolution over a larger portion of the image. This implementation in pseudo-code is:"

The function also returns the ratio $R_{\\textrm{PSF}}$ of the the highest PSF sidelobe to the PSF main lobe, this will be less than 1. The justification for truncating the PSF is that the majority of the power in the PSF is contained within this region. And, any pixel in the image which is higher than the first sidelobe (as a fraction of the peak pixel flux) contains a source. The trade-off in the size of the PSF subset is that the smaller it is the more of the image can be deconvolved, but at the cost of increased errors.

    "`CLEAN` methods were first implemented in a time of limited computing and memory resources. Careful consideration was required in optimizing these deconvolution methods with in these constraints. This led to good approximate solutions to deconvolution. As computing power and memory has become cheaper more advanced deconvolution methods are continuously in development. These methods are beyond the scope of the course, but are part of an active field of research. See the end of this chapter for [references &#10142;](6_x_further_reading_and_references.ipynb) to current work.\n",

Just to be clear, the ungridded visibilities are the visibilities produced during an observation, before they are gridded onto a 2-D plane as descirbed in [$\\S$ 5.3](../5_Imaging/5_3_gridding_and_degridding.ipynb). The Cotton-Schwab method allows for deconvolution across the entire image and does not introduce PSF artefact aliasing at the cost of an increase in computation and memory usage. The Cotton-Schwab method is still widely used today and is the basis for most subsequent `CLEAN` implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just as `CLEAN` is a general term for deconvolution using an iterative sky model subtraction process, the Cotton-Schwab method can vary based on implementation and which additional features are included. As such, it is not possible to write an easy pseudo-code implementation in the abstract. But, at a high level the Cotton-Schwab method follows Clark's major/minor cycle model. But, instead of subtracting the gridded visibilities from the sky model in the major cycle, a method is used to compute the ungridded visibilities for the sky model. There are two methods to generate ungridded visibilities from the sky model:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If there are only a few sources in the sky model a direct Fourier transform can be used on each source to compute the exact visibilities for each *uv* sample.\n",
    "2. When there are many sources in the sky model, as is usually the case, the sky model is transformed to gridded visibilities as in Clark's methods then a [de-gridder &#10142;](../5_Imaging/5_3_gridding_and_degridding.ipynb) is used to make a close approximation to the ungridded visibilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "These visibilities based on the sky model, often called *model visibilities*, can be used in the 'self-cal cycle', which is discussed in [$\\S$8.3](../8_Calibration/8_2_1GC.ipynb). The model visibilities are subtracted from the observed visibilities resulting in *residual visibilities*. The residual visibilities are then imaged to produce a new residual image and the next iteration of deconovlution can proceed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deconvolving with the ungridded visibilities has a number of other advantages to Högbom and Clark's methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "* There are no PSF aliasing effects because the deconvolution is independent of image size.\n",
    "* Spatial regions of interest can be separately deconvolved or ignored, allowing for fine control over the sky modelling process.\n",
    "* The w-term can be accounted for when producing the residual image from the sky model resulting in a more accurate sky model and fewer artefacts in the residual image.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point it should be clear that the Cotton-Schwab method (and all its derivative methods) has many advantages over the methods discussed previously in this section, and is the standard `CLEAN` deconvolution method today. It is important to note here that when the discussion of computing limits in deconvolution the gridding/de-gridding process dominates the computational operations and memory budget over all other steps. Complementary to the development of new deconvolution algorithms is the topic of efficient implementation of well developed methods. Högbom and Clark's methods are still used in some cases, such as in simple fields, and are useful to understand as there is a progression from their simplicity to the more complex modern forms of `CLEAN` used today."

This would lead to a circular sampling function and airy disc PSF which, as we have seen in [$\\S$ 5.2](../5_Imaging/5_2_sampling_functions_and_psfs.ipynb) has sidelobes. A more ideal array would have a taper to make a smooth, continuous sampling function to lead to a smooth, sidelobe-free PSF, such as a Gaussian. A 2-D Gaussian, fit to the main lobe of the observation PSF, is often taken as the ideal PSF. The Gaussian function has the advantage of being easy to fit to the PSF main lobe and maintains the resolution of the image without introducing sidelobes. Other ideal PSF can be chosen, such as just selecting the main lobe of the observation PSF, but a Gaussian ideal PSF is standard in most imagers. This size scale can vary by implementation but a typical method is to fit a rotated 2-D Gaussian function to the main lobe of the PSF. Another method is to compute the full-width at half maximum of the PSF and then construct a 2-D Gaussian with the same full-width at half maximum.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a decolvolution is performed on an image the ideal PSF size is usually computed and as part of the standard output, and put in the FITS file header. Code in the $\\S$ 6.3.5 shows how to extract the ideal PSF from the header."

    "#### Multiple Frequencies\n",
    "\n",
    "We have glossed over the issue of multiple frequencies. We have discussed how an increase in observing bandwidth leads to a improved *uv* coverage in [$\\S$ 5.2 &#10142;](../5_Imaging/5_2_sampling_functions_and_psfs.ipynb). But, this is only true for sources which have flat spectral indicies, which never occurs. But, this is a good approximation when the bandwidth is narrow enough such that sources can be treated as flat spectrum. This can work well in many cases, but for wide bandwidth observations this approximation breaks down. A better approximation is to treat each source as having a flux and spectral index parameter (instead of just a flux parameter) which are determined during deconvolution, this process is called [<cite data-cite='2011A&A...532A..71R'>multi-frequency synthesis</cite> &#10548;](http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.2745).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Widefield Approximation\n",
    "\n",
    "From the  van Cittert-Zernike theorem we kow the visibility-image domain Fourier relation only holds for the small angle approximation. We can correct for this by using more computing power to improve the approximation with w-term correction, see [$\\S$ 5.5 &#10142;](../5_Imaging/5_5_widefield_effect.ipynb). Many modern imagers and deconvolution algorithms include w-term correction options by default. But, a limitation of `CLEAN` is that the PSF that is used during the minor cycle is the PSF for the array pointing at the phase centre. In fact, the PSF changes depending on direction, so sources far from the phase centre will have been convolved with a different PSF response compared to the deconvolving PSF. This leads to poor deconvolution results with a point source being spread out into different components at slightly different positions. See [<cite data-cite='1992A&A...261..353C'>Radio-interferometric imaging of very large fields - The problem of non-coplanar arrays</cite> &#10548;](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1992A&A...261..353C) for solutions using facet imaging and 3-D Fourier transforms.\n",

    "\n",
    "We have not discussed deconvolution of extended sources in depth. This is a coplex topic and one of the main challenges in developing modern deconvolution algorithms. Extended sources greatly open up the parameter space and are difficult to work with in a geenric way. An expansion of the point-source based deconvolution method has been [<cite data-cite='2011A&A...532A..71R'>multi-scale CLEAN</cite> &#10548;](http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.2745) which  introduces a Gaussian basis set along with the $\\delta$-fuction basis set which is used to model any source with Gaussians of different size scales.\n",

    "Another approach has been to take advantage of developments in compressed sensing to perform deconvolution in different basis domains, such as wavelet-based deconvoltion ([<cite data-cite='2015A&A...576A...7D'>MORESANE</cite> &#10548;](http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.5387)).\n",

    "#### Model Selection\n",

The idea here is that deconvolution is an approximate, intermediate step which can be avoided. Further, by avoiding deconvolution a probability can be set on different models. \n",

There are various modifications and extension of the original `clean` methods which are now used regularly in synthesis imaging. One topic we have not discussed so far is when do we decide to halt the deconvolution process and how do we know we have maximized the amount of deconvolution possible? These are difficult questions to answer,  we will discuss why this is so in the next section."
