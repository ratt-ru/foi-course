Since we are making an incomplete sampling of the visibilities with limited resolution we do not recover the 'true' sky from an observation. The dirty image is the 'true' sky convolved (effectively blurred) out by the array point spread function (PSF). As discussed in the previous chapter, the PSF acts as a type of low-pass spatial filter limiting our resolution of the sky. We would like to some how recover a model for the true sky. At the end of deconvolution one of the outputs is the sky model.\n",

The sky model looks like a mostly empty image with a few non-zero pixels. The PSF is the same as the one shown in the previous chapter."

As we have seen in [$\\S$ 5.4 &#10142;](../5_Imaging/5_4_imaging_weights.ipynb) the choice of weighting functions can result in different PSF resolutions. But, no matter the array there is a limit to the resolution, so any source which has a smaller angular scale than the PSF resolution appears to be a *point source*. A point source is an idealized source which has no angular scale and is represented by a spatial Dirac $\\delta$-function. Though all sources in the sky have a angular scale, many are much smaller than the angular resolution of the array PSF, so they can be approximated as a simple point source.\n",

The short answer is 'yes', the long answer 'yes to a limit' and current research is focused on using more advanced techniques to improve deconvolution. This is because the 2D Dirac $\\delta$-function can be used as a complete orthogonal basis set to describe any 2D function. Most sources in the sky are *unresolved*, that is they have a much smaller angular resolution then that of the array PSF. Sky sources which are *resolved* are a bit trickier, we will consider these sources later in the section. \n",
    "\n",
    "A $\\delta$-function basis set is also good for astronomical images because these images are generally *sparse*. That is, out of the thousands or millions of pixels in the image, only a few of the pixels contain sky sources (i.e. these pixels contain the information we desire) above the observed noise floor, the rest of the pixels contain mostly noise (i.e. contain no information). This differs from a natural image, for example a photograph of a duck, which is simply a collection of $\\delta$-functions with different constant scale factors, one for each pixel in the image. Every pixel in a natural image generally contains information. We would say that in the $\\delta$-function basis set a natural image is not sparse. As a side note, a natural image is usually sparse in wavelet space which is why image compression uses wavelet transforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since an astronomical image is sparse we should be able to reduce the image down to separate out the noise from the sources and produce a small model which represents the true sky, this is the idea behind deconvolution. Looked in a different way, deconvolution is a process of filtering out the true sky flux from the instrument induced noise in each pixel. This idea of sparseness and information in aperture synthesis images is related to the field of compressed sensing. Much of the current research in radio interferometric deconvolution is framed in the compressed sensing context.\n",

    "An additional issue that arises is that an array PSF size varies depending on observing frequency during an observation. An observation is made over a set frequency bandwidth, and the baseline length is measured in number of wavelengths and not metres. We used this to our advantage to fill the *uv*-plane in [$\\S$ 5.2 &#10142;](../5_Imaging/5_2_sampling_functions_and_psfs.ipynb). The highest frequency observation will have a better resolution then the lowest frequency observation. In the past this was not an issue because the difference in fractional bandwidth between the top and bottom of the observing band was usually small and the resolution could be approximated as constant across the band. But, modern telescopes have large fractional bandwidths, resulting in significant resolution difference between the lowest and highest frequencies. This leads to issues where, on a single baselines, a source can be resolved at high frequency but is  unresolved at a lower frequency. The issue of imaging and deconvolution with wide bandwidth systems is a topic of active research.\n",

    "Now that we have justified the use of $\\delta$-functions to describe a sky model, even as approximations to extended sources, we are now ready to see how a sky model is constructed from the dirty image via deconvolution."
